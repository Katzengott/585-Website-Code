				<p>Hello, my name is Joey585. I enjoy playing video games, hiking, playing with animals, and coding. I created this website to really see if this whole 585 company could take off. Right now, its going great and I am learning so much along the way! The website is improving slowly but surely. My plans for this company is very weak. I am not sure where to go next after the website is created.</p>
